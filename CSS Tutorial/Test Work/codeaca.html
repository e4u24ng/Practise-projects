    <p>The world is full of fascinating places. Planning the perfect vacation involves packing up, leaving home, and
        experiencing something new.</p>

    <h2 class='destination heading-background'>1. Florence, Italy</h2>
    <div class='description'>A city-size shrine to the Renaissance, Florence offers frescoes, sculptures, churches,
        palaces, and other monuments from the richest cultural flowering the world has known. Names from its dazzling
        historical past; Dante, Michelangelo, Galileo, Machiavelliare are some of the most resonant of the medieval age.

    <h2 class='destination heading-background'>2. Beijing, China</h2>
    <div class='description'>A city in the midst of reinventing itself and continuing to build on the success of the
        2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing is a place of frenzied construction. New housing, new roads, and new sports venues
        seem to spring up overnight. At the same time, the capital of the Peoples Republic of China remains an epicenter
        of tradition, with the treasures of nearly 2,000 years as the imperial capital still on view in the famed
        Forbidden City and in the luxuriant pavilions and gardens of the Summer Palace.

    <h2 class='destination heading-background'>3. Seoul, South Korea</h2>
    <div class='description'>The Korean capital is a city of contrasts. Fourteenth-century city gates squat in the
        shadow of 21st-century skyscrapers, while the broad Han River is back-dropped by granite mountains rising in the
        city center complete with alpine highways speeding around their contours and temples nestling among their crags.
        Fashionable, gadget-laden youths battle for sidewalk space with fortune-tellers and peddlers, while tiny
        neighborhoods of traditional cottages contrast with endless ranks of identical apartments.

            <h1>Conservation Efforts at Lake Tahoe Being Praised by Nation's Leaders</h1>
        </div>

    <div id="main" class="content">
        <h3>THE STATE'S LATEST CONSERVATION EFFORTS ARE BEING HERALDED BY NATION'S TOP LEADERS AS GROUNDBREAKING AND
            FORWARD THINKING.</h3>
        <span class="byline">WRITTEN BY: JAMES JAYCE</span>
        <p>Until recently, construction on the banks of the Lake had been largely under the control of real estate
            developers. Construction activities have resulted in a clouding of the lake's blue waters. Currently, the
            Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is regulating construction along the shoreline and has won two Federal
            Supreme Court battles over recent decisions. These regulations are unpopular with many residents, especially
            those in the Tahoe Lakefront Homeowners Association.</p>

        <p>The League to Save Lake Tahoe (Keep Tahoe Blue) has been an environmental watchdog in the Lake Tahoe Basin
            for 50 years. Founded when a proposal to build a four-lane highway around the lake (with a bridge over the
            entrance to Emerald Bay) was proposed in 1957, the League has thwarted poorly designed development projects
            and environmentally unsound planning. The League embraces responsible and diversified use of the Lake's
            resources while protecting and restoring its natural attributes.</p>

        <div class="pull-quote">
            <h2>"THE LEAGUE EMBRACES RESPONSIBLE AND DIVERSIFIED USE OF THE LAKE'S RESOURCES WHILE PROTECTING AND
                RESTORING ITS NATURAL ATTRIBUTES"</h2>
        </div>

        <p>Since 1980, the Lake Tahoe Interagency Monitoring Program (LTIMP) has been measuring stream discharge and
            concentrations of nutrients and sediment in up to 10 tributary streams in the Lake Tahoe Basin,
            California-Nevada. The objectives of the LTIMP are to acquire and disseminate the water quality information
            necessary to support science-based environmental planning and decision making in the basin. The LTIMP is a
            cooperative program with support from 12 federal and state agencies with interests in the Tahoe Basin. This
            data set, together with more recently acquired data on urban runoff water quality, is being used by the
            Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board to develop a program (mandated by the Clean Water Act) to
            limit the flux of nutrients and fine sediment to the Lake.</p>

        <p>UC Davis remains a primary steward of the lake. The UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center is dedicated
            to research, education and public outreach, and to providing objective scientific information for
            restoration and sustainable use of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Each year, it produces a well-publicized "State of
            the Lake" assessment report.</p>
